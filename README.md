# LPG-gas-leakage-detector
It is the iot based project mainly used for detecting the  gas leakage by using gas sensor and the HC-05  bluetooth is used  for connecting  to mobile phone for receiving the message when the gas is leaked.This project proposes a low-cost, efficient, and reliable gas leakage detection system using a
Arduino board and a HC05 module. The system is designed to detect gas leaks in real time. 
And send Message alerts to authorities or homeowners in case of a gas leakage. The system 
Consists of a gas sensor module, an Arduino board, and a HC05 module. The gas sensor detects 
the gas leakage and sends the signal to the Arduino board, which then sends a Message alert 
to the predefined mobile number using the HC05module. The system is powered. By a battery 
and can be installed in homes, industries, or any other place where gas leakage Is a concern. 
The proposed system provides an early warning system to prevent gas-related Accidents and 
ensures safety and security. This project not only aims to provide a reliable gas leakage 
detection solution but also emphasizes the importance of safety in everyday environments. By 
integrating modern technology with practical applications, it seeks to minimize risk associated 
with gas leaks and enhance overall safety for user.
